# The Input File Format

- Line 1 contains NE (the number of all E-therapy devices), NU (the number of all U-therapy devices), NG (the number of all X-therapy Gym rooms).
- Line 2 contains the capacity of each NG room.
- Line 3 contains the cancel and rescheduling probability Pcancel and Presc %, two integers from 0 to 100.
- Line 4 contains P (the number of all patients).
- Then P lines, where each line represents the information of a patient.
- Each of the P lines contains:
  1. Patient Type: one char, N for normal, and R for recovering.
  2. Appointment time (PT) and Arrival time (VT).
  3. Number of required treatments by this patient (NT), then for each required treatment, input its Type and Duration. Each treatment type is one char: E for E-therapy, U for U-therapy, and X for X-therapy.

Note: each patient can have at most 3 treatment types and cannot have the same treatment type more than once.

Example 1:
N 50 40 2 U 10 X 5
This patient is normal (N), has an appointment at timestep 50, will arrive at timestep 40, and has 2 required treatments: a U-therapy for 10 timesteps (duration) then an X-therapy for 5 timesteps (treatment order matters).

Example 2:
R 30 35 3 U 6 E 5 X 10
This patient is recovering (R), has an appointment at 30, will arrive at 35 (late), and has 3 required treatments: a U-therapy for 6 timesteps, an E-therapy for 5 timesteps, then an X-therapy for 10 timesteps.


Please Match This format to work fine I'm not responsible of if you did anything else .

For Example :

3 1 2        ☐ 3 E-therapy devices, 1 U-therapy device, 2 X-therapy gym rooms.
10 5         ☐ For the 2 gym rooms, capacity of 1st is 10 patients, and 2nd is 5.
10 30        ☐ Pcancel = 10% and Presc = 30%.
4            ☐ 4 patients, then we have 4 lines next, one per patient.
N 30 25 3 E 5 U 12 X 10
R 30 35 3 U 6 E 5 X 10
R 50 40 1 X 5
N 40 40 2 X 15 U 10
